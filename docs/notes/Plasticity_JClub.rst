Stability and Competition in Multi-spike Models of Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity

pair-based STDP and multi-spike STDP model
--------------------------------------------

The simplest STDP model takes into account pairs of pre- and postsynaptic spikes only. When presynaptic spike precedes postsynaptic spike, synapses are potentiated; otherwise synaptic depression induced. But it doesn't fit all scenarios in nervous system.

In light of experimental results, when multiple pre- and postsynaptic spikes arrive in a short time, triplets of spikes like 'pre-post-pre' and 'post-pre-post' inducing different synaptic effects. So multi-spike STDP model is aiming at fixing the gap.

Three multi-spike STDP models were proposed based on empirical study:

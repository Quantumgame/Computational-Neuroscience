Stability and Competition in Multi-spike Models of Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity

pair-based STDP and multi-spike STDP model
--------------------------------------------

The simplest STDP model takes into account pairs of pre- and postsynaptic spikes only. When presynaptic spike precedes postsynaptic spike, synapses are potentiated; otherwise synaptic depression induced. But it doesn't fit all scenarios in nervous system.

In light of experimental results, when multiple pre- and postsynaptic spikes arrive in a short time, triplets of spikes like 'pre-post-pre' and 'post-pre-post' inducing different synaptic effects. So multi-spike STDP model is aiming at fixing the gap.

Three multi-spike STDP models were proposed based on empirical study:

Two features of synaptic plasticity model: stability and competition
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Stability: a property of the distribution of synaptic weights, fall into three classifications, unstable, partially stable, and stable.






Is cortical connectivity optimized for storing information

Background
-------------

Anatomical studies suggested the pyramidal neurons in neocortex should be fully connected, but electrophysiological evidence confirmed merely around 10% neuron pairs are connected, and there are *bidirectional connections* and high order network motifs.

Recurrent connectivity is believed to maximize the ability for network to store information. But how? There are two theories tend to explain it.

Information is stored in the format of attractor states. (some neurons fire more internsive than others, background activity)

Information is stored in the format of sequences of activity.

But the flaw of current research is they assumed a very specific connection rule for the network. So to make the conclusion convincing, Gardner's approach is used: they consider all connection possibilities, only if the specific pattern of activities is learned.

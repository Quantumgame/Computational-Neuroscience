Immature dentate gyrus and psychiatric disorder
====================================================
This is challenging because psychiatric disorders are diagnosed on the basis of behavioral characteristics and not biological criteria.

studies have identified the “immature dentate gyrus (iDG),” a potential brain endophenotype shared by several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

.. admonition:: Endophenotype
   :class: note

   endophenotype: Endophenotype is a genetic epidemiology term which is used to separate behavioral symptoms into more stable phenotypes with a clear genetic connection.


.. admonition:: iDG
   :class: note

   iDG: In the iDG phenotype, most of the granule cells or principal neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) within the hippocampus are arrested at a pseudoimmature status, in which the molecular and physiological properties are similar to those of normal immature neurons from the DG.

iDG exists in both mutant mice and human patients.

* mutant mice: :math:`\alpha`-CaMKII heterozygous knockout mice, Schnurri-2 (Shn-2) knockout mice, mutant SNAP-25 knock-in mice, mice treated with chronic fluoxwtine, pilocarpine-induced mouse model of epilepsy.
* patients: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder.
